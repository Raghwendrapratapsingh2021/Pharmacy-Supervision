# Pharmacy-Supervision
The C++ MySQL Pharmacy Management System is a software application that integrates MySQL database functionality into a C++ program to manage various aspects of a pharmacy. It provides a console-based user interface. It aims to streamline pharmacy operations, enhance efficiency, and maintain accurate records for better decision-making.
This is accomplished by compiling a database of the storeâ€™s available medications. The major goal of a pharmacy management system is to increase accuracy while also improving safety and efficiency in the pharmacy. The goal of this project is to create software that will help a pharmaceutical store run more efficiently. This software was created to help ensure effective enforcement by providing statistics on the narcotics in stock.
